responsive-sites
================

This is my attempt to build a list of reponsive sites that we can use to test against e.g. compare performance between mobile and desktop environments as Guy Podjarny does.

Initial list is comprised of the sites on http://mediaqueri.es and the list @yoavweiss built from @beep's timeline.

Pull requests welcome!
